# Hallucination Eval

Welcome to **Hallucination Eval**! This project aims to provide tools, metrics, and workflows for evaluating and detecting hallucinations in language models (LLMs). Hallucinations are instances where AI models generate text that is plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or not grounded in source data. Accurate detection and quantification of such outputs is crucial for trustworthy AI applications.

## Features

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Standard and custom metrics for hallucination detection.
- **Benchmark Datasets**: Datasets for testing LLM outputs against known ground-truth.
- **Analysis Tools**: Scripts and notebooks for running evaluations and visualizing results.
- **Extensible Framework**: Add your own models, metrics, or datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- (Optional) PyTorch or TensorFlow for running deep learning models
- Recommended: `pip` for Python package management

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neohack22/hallucination-eval.git
cd hallucination-eval
```

Install dependencies (if requirements.txt exists):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Main entry points for evaluation are likely in scripts or notebooks. Example:

```bash
python eval.py --model my-llm --input data/test.json --metric faithfulness
```

Or open one of the example notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
